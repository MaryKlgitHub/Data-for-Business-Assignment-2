# Week 2 Group Assignment: Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistical Inference

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Week 2 group assignment focused on extending the initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) conducted in Week 1 and incorporating statistical inference methods. The project has four primary tasks:

1. **Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    - Build upon the previous EDA, focusing on **univariate** and **bivariate** analyses.
    - Visual representations (charts, graphs) are used to enhance the understanding of data patterns.

2. **Hypothesis Testing**:
    - Generate hypotheses based on insights from the EDA.
    - Perform statistical tests such as **t-tests** and **chi-square tests** to validate these hypotheses.
    - Interpret statistical results, including **p-values** and **confidence intervals**.

3. **Correlation and Regression Analysis**:
    - Identify and explain any significant **correlations** between variables in the dataset.
    - If applicable, perform **regression analysis** to explore the relationship between key variables.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**:
    - Translate the analytical findings into actionable recommendations.
    - Provide clear evidence on how the data analysis informed the proposed solutions.

## Tasks Breakdown

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We conducted a more detailed EDA using both univariate and bivariate analyses:

- **Univariate Analysis**: Focused on understanding the distribution of individual variables. For instance, we analyzed unemployment rates across different demographic groups (men, women) and time periods.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Explored relationships between two variables, such as unemployment rates and time periods, to uncover trends and relationships.

The results of the EDA are visually represented through:
- **Histograms**
- **Box plots**
- **Scatter plots**
- **Correlation matrices**

These visualizations are designed to highlight important patterns and trends in the data.

### Task 2: Hypothesis Testing
Based on our EDA findings, we developed several hypotheses regarding unemployment rates and potential influencing factors, such as gender and time periods. We conducted statistical tests to validate these hypotheses:

- **t-tests** to compare means across different groups (e.g., male vs. female unemployment rates).
- **Chi-square tests** for categorical data comparisons.

Each test was accompanied by an interpretation of:
- **p-values**: To assess the statistical significance.
- **Confidence intervals**: To understand the range of plausible values for population parameters.

### Task 3: Correlation and Regression Analysis
We identified significant correlations between different variables. These correlations were analyzed to understand their real-world implications, such as how changes in one variable (e.g., unemployment rate for men) might relate to another (e.g., time periods or unemployment rate for women).

Additionally, where relevant, a basic **regression analysis** was performed to model the relationship between variables, helping to explain and predict unemployment trends.

### Task 4: Insights and Recommendations
Based on the data analysis, we provided several recommendations addressing the core problem (unemployment and gender disparity):

- Identified potential solutions to improve employment rates within certain demographics.
- Proposed data-driven policies or interventions based on observed patterns in unemployment trends.
- Supported all recommendations with evidence derived from the data.

## Files and Structure

- `unemployment_rate.ipynb`: The primary Jupyter notebook containing the EDA, statistical tests, and regression analysis.
- **Visualizations**: Charts and graphs embedded in the notebook to support the analysis.
- **Statistical Test Results**: Included directly in the notebook, with interpretations of their significance.

## Conclusion

This project aims to use data-driven analysis to derive actionable insights. By extending our exploratory data analysis and performing statistical inference, we provide a clearer understanding of unemployment trends and propose relevant recommendations based on the data.

## Further Improvements
We welcome further research and data analysis improvements. As the dataset evolves, additional tests or more sophisticated models can be incorporated for deeper insights.
